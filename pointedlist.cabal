Name:          pointedlist
Version:       0.6
Synopsis:      A zipper-like comonad which works as a list, tracking a position.
Category:      Data
Description:
    A PointedList tracks the position in a non-empty list which works similarly
    to a zipper. A current item is always required, and therefore the list may
    never be empty.

    A circular PointedList wraps around to the other end when progressing past
    the actual edge.
